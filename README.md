# E-commerce Performance Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on an e-commerce database. The project leverages SQL for data querying and analysis, a Power BI dashboard for visualization, and a machine learning model for forecasting sales and revenue trends. It was a collaborative effort by our team, with contributions including database setup on Azure, SQL-based insights, and predictive analytics.

## Project Components

### 1. SQL Analysis
- **Responsibility**: Conducted by [ALbaraa mohamed , mostafa samir ,toka magdy ].
- **Description**: In-depth analysis of the e-commerce database using SQL to extract key metrics such as monthly revenue, regional sales, product performance, and customer behavior.
- **Key Insights**: 
  - Monthly revenue: $36.08M with 33.84% MoM growth.
  - Regional sales distribution and top-performing products identified.
  - Return rate: 1.26% and total discounts given: 53.15K.

### 2. Azure Database Setup
- **Description**: The project utilizes an Azure-hosted SQL Server database to store and manage e-commerce data, ensuring scalability and secure access.

### 3. Power BI Dashboard
- **Responsibility**: Developed by [mentallah ,salma , tabark , mohamed].
- **Description**: An interactive dashboard created with Power BI to visualize sales performance, customer metrics, and product analytics. Key features include:
  - Total customers, returning customers percentage, and average order value.
  - Sales trends by month and day, regional sales maps, and product return rates.
- **Usage**: The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore data insights (screenshots or links to dashboards can be included if available).

### 4. Machine Learning Model
- **Responsibility**: Built by [mostafa samir , toka magdy ].
- **Description**: A predictive model using Python (e.g., Prophet, RandomForestRegressor) to forecast future revenue based on historical sales data. The model includes:
  - Feature engineering (e.g., date features, lag variables).
  - Training on 80% of the data with a test on the remaining 20%.
  - Predicted yearly revenue for the next three years (e.g., 2026-2028).
- **Code**: Included in the uploaded notebook (`ecommerce_dbbbbbbbb.ipynb`).
